## 16-bit kernel inspired by DOS.

This is my kernel/OS, written in mainly C with some assembler.

It is 16-bit to ensure compatability with my 286 machines, all the way up to modern machines with BIOS emulation.

## Features

- 2 stage bootloader
- Monolothic kernel
- Userspace programs
- I/O Redirection
- Serial I/O
- Fat16 Filesystem
